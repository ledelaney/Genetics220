15. It has been shown that, when a thin beam of light is aimed at a nucleus, the amount of light absorbed is proportional to the cell’s DNA content. Using this method, the DNA in the nuclei of several different types of cells in a corn plant were compared. The following numbers represent the relative amounts of DNA in these different types of cells:

20. In mice, dwarfism is caused by an X-linked recessive allele, and pink coat is caused by an autosomal dominant allele (coats are normally brownish). If a dwarf female from a pure line is crossed with a pink male from a pure line, what will be the phenotypic ratios in the F1 and F2 in each sex? (Invent and define your own gene symbols.)

28. In dogs, dark coat color is dominant over albino and short hair is dominant over long hair. Assume that these effects are caused by two independently assorting genes. Seven crosses were done as shown below, in which D and A stand for the dark and albino phenotypes, respectively, and S and L stand for the short-hair and long-hair phenotypes.

15. The cross _E/E · F/F_ x _e/e · f/f_ is made, and the F1 is then backcrossed with the recessive parent. The progeny genotypes are inferred from the phenotypes. The progeny genotypes, written as the gametic contributions of the heterozygous parent, are in the following proportions:

\

_E·F_  2/6 

_E·f_  1/6 

_e·F_  1/6

22. You have a Drosophila line that is homozygous for autosomal recessive alleles a, b, and c, linked in that order. You cross females of this line with males homozygous for the corresponding wild-type alleles. You then cross the F1 heterozygous males with their heterozygous sisters. You obtain the following F2 phenotypes (where letters denote recessive phenotypes and pluses denote wild-type phenotypes):

23. R. A. Emerson crossed two different pure-breeding lines of corn and obtained a phenotypically wild-type F1 that was heterozygous for three alleles that determine recessive phenotypes: _an_ determines anther; _br_, brachytic; and _f_, fine. He testcrossed the F1 with a tester that was homozygous recessive for the three genes and obtained these progeny phenotypes: 355 anther; 339 brachytic, fine; 88 completely wild type; 55 anther, brachytic, fine; 21 fine; 17 anther, brachytic; 2 brachytic; 2 anther, fine.

45. A corn geneticist wants to obtain a corn plant that has the three dominant phenotypes: anthocyanin (A), long tassels (L), and dwarf plant (D). In her collection of pure lines, the only lines that bear these alleles are _AA LL dd_ and _aa ll DD_. She also has the fully recessive line _aa ll dd_. She decides to intercross the first two and testcross the resulting hybrid to obtain in the progeny 0 plant of the desired phenotype (which would have to be _Aa Ll Dd_ in this case). She knows that the three genes are linked in the order written and that the distance between the _A/a_ and the _L/l_ loci is 16 map units and that the distance between the _L/l_ and the _D/d_ loci is 24 map units.
