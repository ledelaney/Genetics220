40. In the plant _Arabidopsis thaliana_, a geneticist is interested in the development of trichomes (small projections). A large screen turns up two mutant plants (A and B) that have no trichomes, and these mutants seem to be potentially useful in studying trichome development. (If they were determined by single-gene mutations, then finding the normal and abnormal functions of these genes would be instructive.) Each plant is crossed with wild type; in both cases, the next generation (F1) had normal trichomes. When F1 plants were selfed, the resulting F2’s were as follows:

`r latex.only("\\vspace{8mm}")`

  - F2 from mutant A: 602 normal; 198 no trichomes 
  - F2 from mutant B: 267 normal; 93 no trichomes

`r latex.only("\\vspace{8mm}")`

`r alpha.list(optnum = 2, opta = "What do these results show? Include proposed genotypes of all plants in your answer.", optb = "Under your explanation to part a, is it possible to confidently predict the F1 from crossing the original mutant A with the original mutant B? ")`

49. In nature, the plant _Plectritis congesta_ is dimorphic for fruit shape; that is, individual plants bear either wingless or winged fruits. Plants were collected from nature before flowering and were crossed or selfed with the following results:

| ----------------- | -------|  ------- |
| Winged (selfed)   |   91   |     1    |
| Winged (selfed)   |   90   |    30    |
| Wingless (selfed) |    4   |    80    |
| Winged x wingless |  161   |     0    |
