  In the plant \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana}, a geneticist is interested
  in the development of trichomes (small projections). A large screen
  turns up two mutant plants (A and B) that have no trichomes, and these
  mutants seem to be potentially useful in studying trichome
  development. (If they were determined by single-gene mutations, then
  finding the normal and abnormal functions of these genes would be
  instructive.) Each plant is crossed with wild type; in both cases, the
  next generation (F1) had normal trichomes. When F1 plants were selfed,
  the resulting F2's were as follows:
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{8mm}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  F2 from mutant A: 602 normal; 198 no trichomes
\item
  F2 from mutant B: 267 normal; 93 no trichomes

\begin{enumerate} 
 \item[a.]{ What do these results show? Include proposed genotypes of all plants in your answer. }
