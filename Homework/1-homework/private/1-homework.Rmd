1. If the white-flowered parental variety in Figure 1-3 were crossed to the first-generation hybrid plant in that figure, what types of progeny would you expect to see and in what proportions?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="35%"}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "input/figure_01_03.jpg")

```

`r latex.only("\\vspace{10mm}")`

**Answer**: Let's assign genotypes for each of these hypothetical parents. First, we assign a genotype of AA to the purple plant, and aa to the white plant. If a pure-breeding (homozygous) purple plant and a pure-breeding (homozygous) white plant mated, we would observe the following:

$$\begin{aligned}
AA \times aa \rightarrow Aa ~
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, all hybrid plants have a genotype of Aa. If we cross this to a pure-breeding white-flowered plant (aa), we observe the following:

+------+--------+------+
|      |   a    |   a  |
+======+========+======+
| A    |  Aa    |  Aa  |
+------+--------+------+
| a    |  aa    |  aa  |
+------+--------+------+

Like all single-locus crosses between a homozygote and heterozygote (with complete dominance), we observe a 1:1 phenotypic and genotypic ratio.

4. Figure 1-7 shows a simplified pathway for arginine synthesis in Neurospora. Suppose you have a special strain of Neurospora that makes citrulline but not arginine. Which gene(s) are likely mutant or missing in your special strain? You have a second strain of Neurospora that makes neither citrulline nor arginine but does make ornithine. Which gene(s) are mutant or missing in this strain?
\

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="45%"}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "input/figure_01_07.jpg")

```

**Answer**: If the mutant strain is able to produce citrulline, then genes A and B must work. Gene C, the gene responsible for the transition from citrulline to arginine, must be mutated.

In the second strain, gene A must be functional since it is able to make ornithine. Gene B must be missing or mutant since it is unable to make citrulline. However, gene C may or may not be missing or mutantated. Enzyme C converts citrulline into arginine (they are in the same sequential pathway), and enzyme C is dependent on the availability of citrulline for its function.

5. Consider Figure 1-8a. `r alpha.list(opta = "What do the small blue spheres represent?", optb = "What do the brown slabs represent?", optc = "Do you agree with the analogy that DNA is structured like a ladder?")`


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="25%"}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "input/figure_01_08a.jpg")

```

`r bold.fix("Answer")`:
`r alpha.list(opta = "The blue ribbon represents sugar phosphate backbone (deoxyribose and a phosphate group), while the blue spheres signify atoms", optb = "Brown slabs show complementary bases (A, T, G, and C)", optc = "Yes, it is a helical structure")`

6. In Figure 1-8b, can you tell if the number of hydrogen bonds between adenine and thymine is the same as that between cytosine and guanine? Do you think that a DNA molecule with a high content of A + T would be more stable than one with a high content of G + C?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="25%"}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "input/figure_01_08b.jpg")

```

**Answer:** There are two hydrogen bonds between adenine and thymine and three between guanine and cytosine. Because A-T has only two hydrogen bonds it will be less stable than a molecule with a high content of G-C (three hydrogen bonds).

10. Below is the sequence of a single strand of a short DNA molecule. On a piece of paper, rewrite this sequence and then write the sequence of the complementary strand below it.

`r latex.only("\\vspace{10mm}")`

GTTCGCGGCCGCGAAC

`r latex.only("\\vspace{10mm}")`

Comparing the top and bottom strands, what do you notice about the relationship between them?

`r latex.only("\\vspace{10mm}")`

**Answer:**

GTTCGCGGCCGCGAAC 

CAAGCGCCGGCGCTTG

They are palindromes --- the same forwards and backwards.

11. Mendel studied a tall variety of pea plants with stems that are 20 cm long and a dwarf variety with stems that are only 12 cm long. `r alpha.list(optnum = 2, opta = "Under blending theory, how long would you expect the stems of first and second hybrids to be?", optb = "Under Mendelian rules, what would you expect to observe in the second-generation hybrids if all the first-generation hybrids were tall?")`

`r latex.only("\\vspace{10mm}")`

`r bold.fix("Answer")`: 
`r alpha.list(optnum = 2, opta = "Blending theory suggests that offspring would exhibit traits in between both parents, i.e., the average. In this case, offspring would be 16cm tall.", optb = "If all F1 hybrids were tall, this suggests that tall is dominant to short and all offspring are heterozygous. Thus, upon mating F1 hybrids, you would expect a 3:1 ratio of tall to short.")`

12. If a DNA double helix that is 100 base pairs in length has 32 adenines, how many cytosines, guanines, and thymines must it have?

`r latex.only("\\vspace{10mm}")`

**Answer:**

A = T and G = C. Therefore, 32 adenines means there are also 32 thymines, for a total of 64 bases. This means the remainder (100 - 64 = 36) are guanines and cytosines. Split 36 in two because the number of Gs and Cs are equal, and you get 18 guanine and 18 cytosine.
